C-Style-String-Reverse

Questions: Write code to reverse a C-Style String. 
(C-String means that “abcd” is represented as  ve characters, including the null character.)

1. Input a string 
2. Convert to char array
3. reverse using temp variable ignore null character [Basially we are doing character swapping here]
4. display
